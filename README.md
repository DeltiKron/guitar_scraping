# guitar_scraping
I was interested on how prices for acoustic guitars vary between different brands and different sets of parameters like age of the model, wood type or guitar shape. Also an especially interesting question for me was how prices for the same instrument or similar categories change over time.

As a first step towards getting a feel for the acoustic-steel string guitar market, I wrote a set of scripts to scrape data on different guitars from one of europes largest online merchants for musical instruments: [Thomann](http://www.thomann.de).

I use cron to run the scraper on a daily basis which then generates the data for me. I might eventually make the dataset public.
